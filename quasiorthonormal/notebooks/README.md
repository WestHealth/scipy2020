# Sample Notebooks

These notebooks perform the MNIST classification in the same manner mentioned in the paper. The cases demonstrated here are

   * [Reference](reference.ipynb) standard one-hot encoding with two layer architectures
   * Quasiorthonormal Encoding using [4-dimensions](qo4.ipynb) and [7-dimensions](qo7.ipynb)
   * Sphere Code Encoding using [3-dimensions](sc3.ipynb) and [5-dimensions](sc5.ipynb)

There is also a [directory](for_fun) where a bunch of different ideas were tried out.
